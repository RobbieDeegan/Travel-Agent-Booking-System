A simple travel agent booking system for a Second Year Java project. 
When the TestBooking class is run, the console will prompt the user for thier 
travel details including name, destination, number of adults of children 
and prints it all to a receipt text file. There are interfaces to add desposits
and booking charges also. The program covers air, bus and car rental services.
